    <h1>Hello and welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>
      Training dogs has been my passion for over 10 years. It all started with
      my first dog Jari, he was Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was extremely smart, so teaching him was one of the easiest things to
      do. A few years later I went to Belgium to get my Malinois girl from a
      breeder, since I wanted to get into obedience training and competitions
      more.
