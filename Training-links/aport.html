    <p>No, it does not have anything to do with being a dummy :D</p>
    <p>
      Dummy training is for any dog, but mostly for the ones that like fetching.
      Retrievers are perfect for it but do not let that stop you, even my
      shepherd loves it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again this is a very simple thing to teach and it keeps your dog busy
      physically and mentally.
    </p>
    <p>A few things we need to teach:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold the dummy</li>
      <li>Fetch from a close distance</li>
      <li>Search in the woods</li>
      <li>Fetch from the water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It basically has no limit, so you can teach whatever you want, once a dog
      knows fetch and search he can find and bring back many different things.
