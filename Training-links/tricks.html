      I started teaching my dogs tricks to make them think and fulfill their
      needs for mental exerciese. Plus because it is fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      When teaching a trick, you should be aware of how the dog learns and if he
      is understanding it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every trick should be divided into several smaller steps, so it is easier
      for the dog to understand and achieve the goal. Sessions should be short
      and effective.
    </p>

    <p>Tricks can be simple, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give me a paw</li>
      <li>Down</li>
      <li>Spin</li>
      <li>Roll-over</li>
      <li>Bark</li>
      <li>Wave</li>
      <li>Focus</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or more difficult or complex ones, like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/OBj9I-U_1Do" target="_blank">Put away toys</a>
      </li>
      <li>Crawling</li>
      <li>Walking backwards</li>
      <li>Stack rings on a stick</li>
      <li>Roll up in a blanket</li>
      <li>Limp</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
