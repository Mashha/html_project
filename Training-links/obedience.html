    <p>
      Obedience was my passion to teach. Something so complicated but so nice at
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teaching obedience can be done with positive reinforcement and not much
      equipment is needed for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedience is something you can do just for fun or more seriously, like
      competing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obedience scheme is built from a few different exercises connected in
      one long pattern.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heel on a leash</li>
      <li>Heel off-leash</li>
      <li>Change pace in heel</li>
      <li>Sit-stay</li>
      <li>Down-stay</li>
      <li>Recall</li>
      <li>Heel in a group</li>
      <li>Long down in the distance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want to see more obedience is recorded in the second part of the
      video of the tricks.
