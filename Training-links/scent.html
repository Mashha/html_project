      Scent is the dogs primary sense. Dogs have up to 100 million receptors in
      nose. In comparison, humans have only 5-6 million.

    <p>
      A dog must find a specific odor that the handler has hidden, ignore
      distractions and alert the handler when he finds it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dog has found the target odor, he is rewarded with either food
      or a toy.

    <h4>What to use for a scent?</h4>
    <p>
      There are many different variations these days; you can use essential
      oils, like birch, anise, or clove.

    <p>
      Or you can also use kong pieces, which is what I use. Firstly you start
      with the big size kong and slowly cut it down until you get a tiny 3mm
      size piece, which is what the dog is searching for at the end.
