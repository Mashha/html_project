    <p>
      Tracking is like the
      <strong>"blind search"</strong>
      . In this fun activity dog also uses his senses to complete the exercise,
      but he has to do it in a prescribed way.
    </p>
    <p>Equipment you will need, besides a big grassy field:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Harness</li>
      <li>10m long line</li>
      <li>Treats</li>
      <li>A few articles</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <p>
      He is not looking for a specific odor like in scentwork, but rather a
      footprint scent and soil damage that is left in the grass after we walked
      on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make several straight lines with corners and articles in between.
      It might look pretty boring if you are not enthusiastic about it, but for
      the dog it's fun.
